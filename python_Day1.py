#python Indentation

"""
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

"""
x= 5
if (x < 10):
    print("x is less than 10")
else:
    print("x is grater than 10")


#python comments

"""
in python # is used to create a comments.
in python three inverted commas used to crate a multiple line comments
comments usually used to explain python code.
comments used to make the code more readable

"""
#this is an single line comment
"""
this is 
an multiple line
comment

#python variables

"""
in any programming language variable is used to store data in it.
python has no command to declare a variable 

"""

 and can even change type after they have been set."""

"""If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting."""
x= int(3) #x will be an integer it's 3 here
y= str(5) #here y will be '5' a string
z= float(7) #here z will be 7.0 a float value

"""
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

MYVAR = "John"

"""in python print() function is used to output variables.
In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma.
also use the + operator to output multiple variables.
For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator.
In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error
The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data type """

"""python global variables
Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, 
and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value."""
